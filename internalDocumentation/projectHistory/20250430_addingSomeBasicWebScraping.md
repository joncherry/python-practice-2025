# Adding Some Basic Web Scraping

## Pull Request

- https://github.com/joncherry/python-practice-2025/pull/3

## Summary
I am new to web scraping and I am still learning how to do things in python that I would normally do in golang. In This PR I have added some very simplistic webscraping for amazon and motorola's websites. Hopefully the webscraping will get better on future contributions to this project.
