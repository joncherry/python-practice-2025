# Endpoints And Oauth

## Pull Request

- https://github.com/joncherry/python-practice-2025/pull/1

## Summary

In this change I added endpoints to get the reports. I used Google Oauth so that endpoints could require someone to sign in with Google before using the endpoints. I also added terminal CLI commands so that you could access the API from the terminal without having to use cURL request commands.
