# Adding Other Data Sources

## Pull Request

- https://github.com/joncherry/python-practice-2025/pull/2

## Summary

I was hoping to add a number of other data sources, but they weren't granular to the state level or other similar issues. In the end I have median home prices in 2021 and median hay prices in 2021. As mentioned in the design doc and the readme, this isn't useful, but it is demonstrating manipulating data.
