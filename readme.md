# Python Practice 2025

This is a project to demonstrate and enhance my python skills. This should help me in future roles on cool projects.

I was given these goals to try to include in the project:
- [ ] üêç Core Python Skills
Proficiency in Python 3. Experience with writing modular, maintainable code. Debugging and exception handling.
- [ ] üîÑ Data Integration & Middleware

- [ ] üåê Web Scraping & Automation
Scraping data with tools like BeautifulSoup, lxml, or Selenium. Handling pagination, dynamic content, and headers/cookies. Respecting robots.txt / rate limits (ethical scraping)
- [ ] üìä Data Handling & Cleaning
Cleaning structured data using pandas. Parsing and exploring unstructured data (e.g., free text, HTML, nested JSON) Familiarity with datetime manipulation, null handling, type coercion.
- [ ] üß† Data Exploration & Troubleshooting
Exploring datasets to identify issues or patterns. Writing scripts to validate, transform, or summarize datasets.
- [ ] ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud / BigQuery / Google Sheets
Reading/writing to BigQuery using google-cloud-bigquery , pandas-gbq. Manipulating Google Sheets with gspread or Google Sheets API. Familiarity with service accounts and OAuth credentials.

The design of this project is will be directed by trying to hit these goals. The data used won't necessarily make sense or be useful. The goal is to demonstrate and practice skills.
